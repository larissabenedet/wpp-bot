# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Interview Bot is an automated WhatsApp-based system designed to help users practice technical interviews by receiving daily programming questions and personalized feedback. The system allows users to register through a web form, specify their preferences for programming language and communication language, and receive one technical question per day via WhatsApp. Users can respond with text or audio, receive AI-powered feedback on their answers, and manage their subscription through simple WhatsApp commands.
